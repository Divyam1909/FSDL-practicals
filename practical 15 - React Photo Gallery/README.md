# Practical 15 - React Photo Gallery

This project is a simple photo gallery built with React, with category filtering.

## Structure
- **App.js**: Contains all the code (React component).

## Features
- **Image Grid**: Displays images in a responsive grid.
- **Category Filter**: Buttons to filter images by category.
- **All**: Show all images.

## Code Highlights
- Uses React's `useState` for filter state.
- Images and categories are hardcoded in arrays.
- Inline styles for layout and appearance.

## How to Run
1. Place `App.js` in a React project (e.g., created with `create-react-app`).
2. Run `npm start` in the project directory.
