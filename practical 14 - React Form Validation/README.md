# Practical 14 - React Form Validation

This project is a simple registration form with validation, built with React.

## Structure
- **App.js**: Contains all the code (React component).

## Features
- **Email Validation**: Checks for valid email format.
- **Password Validation**: Requires at least 6 characters.
- **Error Messages**: Shows errors below each field.
- **Alert on Success**: Shows alert if registration is valid.

## Code Highlights
- Uses React's `useState` for form state and errors.
- Validation logic in a single function.
- Inline styles for layout and error display.

## How to Run
1. Place `App.js` in a React project (e.g., created with `create-react-app`).
2. Run `npm start` in the project directory.
