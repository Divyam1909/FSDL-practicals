# Practical 11 - React Counter App

This project is a simple counter app built with React.

## Structure
- **App.js**: Contains all the code (React component).

## Features
- **Increment**: Increases the counter by 1.
- **Decrement**: Decreases the counter by 1.
- **Reset**: Sets the counter to 0.

## Code Highlights
- Uses React's `useState` hook for state management.
- Inline styles for layout and appearance.
- All logic and UI in a single functional component.

## How to Run
1. Place `App.js` in a React project (e.g., created with `create-react-app`).
2. Run `npm start` in the project directory.
